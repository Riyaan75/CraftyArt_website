            Blue pottery is a widely popular traditional craft from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Although, the art originally has a Turko-Persian background.The name ‘Blue Pottery’ comes from a vibrant cobalt blue dye colour that artists use for making articles.
            It is specifically a blue and white form of pottery, which is Euroasian in type. The size and shape of art take influences from Chinese pottery.
            While carving the port for this craft, there is no usage of no clay. Craftsmen use quartz stone powder, powdered glass, gum borax and Multani mitti (Fuller’s Earth) and water to make a dough for the port article.
            These pottery items are normally embellished with animals, birds and flower motifs. Handicrafts that are commonly made with pottery include a flower vase, ashtray, small bowls and ports.

          <h2>Puppets</h2>
          <p>
            A puppet is familiar in India as a kathputli. The name links back with two Rajasthani language words, Kath meaning wood and Putli, which means no life.
            Kathputli means a puppet, which is completely made with wood. An artist uses cotton and colourful clothes to make them look stunning.
            Puppet or kathputli has roots from Nagaur, Rajasthan and surrounding areas. The capital of India, New Delhi also has an area by the name of ‘Kathputli Colony’ in Shadipur Depot.  This is where all the puppet workers, musicians, and dancers live.
            According to many historians, this art is a thousand years old. The tradition of Kathputli began with ancient folk tales about rich kings and kingdoms.
            With the passage of time, it became a source of entertainment. Puppet shows take place across traditional fairs, reflecting social issues or subjects.

          <h2>Stone Carving</h2>
          <p>
            Existing in India since the 7th century BC, stone carving art is a very rich traditional craft. The skills usually are passed down from father to son.
            The classical cultural stonework is like an extension of architecture. Rajasthan is naturally wealthy in marbles, granites, slates, quartzite, and other rocks. Thus it has become a centre for stone carvers.
            In addition, the great quality of marbles and sandstones extracted from various mining and had given fame to sculptors.
            Mines in Makrana, Rajasthan are famous for its marbles. Marbles of Makrana quarries were used in making of the Taj Mahal, which is one of the wonders of the world.
            In medieval and ancient times, there was no use of brickwork. Hence, the effortless availability of stones made it easy for architects to make many more wonderful forts and places.
